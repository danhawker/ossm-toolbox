# OSSM-Toolbox

This repo contains a series of collated utils, notes and setups for use with OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM).


## LocalityLB

This focuses on the setup of a multi-primary, multi-cluster, single mesh environment using OSSM3 (TP2), and applying differing Locality Load Balancing scenarios.

It assumes you have two separate OpenShift 4.17 clusters already setup and available to deploy OSSM3 onto.
